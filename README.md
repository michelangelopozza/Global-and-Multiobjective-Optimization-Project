# Global-and-Multiobjective-Optimization-Project
This project investigates the effectiveness of Grammatical Evolution (GE) applied to the problem of Symbolic Regression for differential equations. The primary objective is to discover analytical expressions that can accurately approximate or reconstruct the physical laws governing specific dynamical systems, starting from observational data
